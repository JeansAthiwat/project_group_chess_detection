# Hardware Synthesis Final Project 2024

This repository contains the final project for the **Hardware Synthesis Course** in the Computer Engineering program at Chulalongkorn University (2024). The project involves implementing Verilog code on the Basys3 FPGA development board, integrating multiple input/output interfaces, and achieving communication between two Basys3 boards.

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design a system that enables input reception, processing, and output display across two Basys3 boards. The system features:

1. **Input Interfaces:**
   - Switches
   - PS/2 Keyboard
   - UART

2. **Inter-Board Communication:**
   - Data received on one Basys3 board is transmitted to another Basys3 board via UART.

3. **Output Display:**
   - The received data is displayed on a **VGA interface** on the second Basys3 board with a GUI.
   - Supports displaying both Thai and English fonts.
